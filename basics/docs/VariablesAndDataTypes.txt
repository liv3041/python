Variable is a name given to a piece of information.

Reasons for variable:
 1. makes code easier.
 2. stores final value of the expression.
 3. easy to follow

var_name = 12
greet = "hello" -> This is a variable assignment statement. 
                
greet + ' world' -> This is an expression that uses the value of the 
                    variable greet

Variable Names:

1. Must start with a letter or an underscore, such as: _underscore or underscore_
2. May consist of letters, numbers, and underscores such as: password1, n00b, u_nder_score
3. Should be descriptive and easy to read:
  - CamelCase
  - snake_case
  - ALL_CAPS
  x streamofconsciounesscase
  x single letter names should not store important values or to be used on more than 
    a couple of lines.
 - Starting with a _symbol is a python convention that means "don't mess with this"
