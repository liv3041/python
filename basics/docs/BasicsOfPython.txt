Basic Rules:
1. Blocks can contain statements and expressions.
2. Expressions can be combined to create more complex expressions.
3. Most statements contain one or more expressions and nested blocks.

Expressions:
1. Represent the idea of using input data to deterine output data.
2. 5 is very simple expression; the input is the number 5, and then we do nothing
   to it, so the output is also the umber 5.
3. 7+3 is also an expression, which combines two other expressions to figure
   out an output value of 10, and (7+3)-8 is an expression too.

Statements:

1. Must be placed directly inside a  block.
2. Do not 'snap together' the way expressions do.
3. Express ideas like 'execute these instructions multiple times' or 
  'decide whether to execute these instructions'.

Blocks:

1. Every python source code file is a block.
2. Many statements contain nested blocks.
3. Nested blocks start with a colon (:) at the end of a line, and then
   the lines of the block are indented.

Python Packages: 
- A package contains a python module (which comprises multiple directories, .py files, and other resource files)
- Its versioned (usually in the form aa.bb.cc)
- Its usually installed/uninstalled/updated via pip, easy_install, conda, and commands.
- Do not confuse the package with the module. Eg: scikit-learn and sklearn.

Pip:
- pip is standard package manager used by Python.
- It is sometimes not installed by default.

Version your package:
- assign version argument a higher number in setup.py file.
- upload your package.
- pip install and pip upgrades will download a newer version.
